# workflows

This is a collection of reusable workflows for various GitHub actions needs (e.g. deploying to GKE). Additionally, there is `templates/` which contains non-reusable (but copy-pasteable) workflow due to GitHub actions not being able to use access private workflows from a public repostiory (e.g. in `otter-sec` organization).
